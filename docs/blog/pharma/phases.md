## Four phases in clinical trials

Phase 1:
- Purpose: safety and dosage; refine phase 2 design
- 20-100 healthy volunteers or patients with disease condition
- Approximately 70% of drugs move to the next phase
  
Phase 2:
- Purpose: efficacy and side effects, refine research questions and design phase3.
- Up to severalhundredspatients
- ~33% move to the nextphase

Phase 3:
- Purpose: efficacy and adverse reactions
- 300~3000 patients
- ~50% move to the next phase

Phase 4:
- Purpose: efficacy and safety
- Phase 4 trials are carried out once the drug or device has been approved by FDA during the Post-Market SafetyMonitoring

## Handling intercurrent events (ICE)

1. Treatment policy strategy: Use the observed data even it is after an ICE.
2. Composite strategy: Occurrence of ICEs is considered as non-responder/failure
3. While-on-treatment strategy: Only use the data while they are on treatment
4. Hypothetical strategy: Discard data after ICE, and estimate what would have happened in the absence of the ICE via appropriate model.
5. Principal stratum strategy: Find a subset of population where the ICE would (or would not) occur in both treatments  

## Types of missing data
1. Missing at Random (MAR): The probability of missingness does NOT depend on the unobserved outcomes of the variable being analyzed
