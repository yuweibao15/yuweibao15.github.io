As I am taking Stochastic Processes class at Tulane University, I want to highlight some definitions from the textbook *Essentials of Stochastic Processes (3rd Edition) by Rick Durrett (Springer, 2016)*

::: tip Discrete type of Markov Chain
A sequence $\{X_n\}$ is a discrete Markov chain with transition matrix $p(i,j)$ if for any $j,i,i_{n-1}$, s.t. 
$$P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i, X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, \dots, X_0 = i_0) = P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i) = p(i,j)$$
