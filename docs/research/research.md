## With passion and dedication:
I am currently working on statistical phylogenetics research under [Dr. Xiang Ji](https://sse.tulane.edu/math/faculty/ji) as well as doing bioinformatics collaboration research with [Deng lab](https://medicine.tulane.edu/deng-lab) under [Dr. Wu-Min Deng](https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/biochemistry-molecular-biology-tulane-cancer-center-tulane-center-aging/all-faculty/wu)

## Past projects
1. Scientific Computations II Class: Techniques for High Accuracy Integration. Collaborated with Kendall 
Gibson on examining two different ways to increase the order of accuracy of the trapezoid rule and Simpson's 
rule involving Taylor expansions and IMT transformation. Mentor: Dr. Ricardo Cortez
2. Epidemic Modeling Study Class: Collaborated with others on the projects (1) Creating a Framework for 
Understanding the Simple Covid-19 Multi-compartmental Model. (2) Examining the Effects of Vaccinations 
and Behavior Changes Towards Covid-19 Pandemic in New Orleans. Mentor: Dr. James Mac Hyman
3. Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Camp (GSMMC) at University of Delaware: Collaborated with others on the project: [Mathematical Models and 
Simulations of Reconfigurable Flow Networks: Erosion, Deposition, Filtration, and Growth.](https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/content-sub-site/Documents/GSMMC_reports/SanaeiReport.pdf) Mentor: Dr. Pejman Sanaei
